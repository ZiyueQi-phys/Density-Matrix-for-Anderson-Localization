## Brief introduction

We provide a new framework to study Anderson localization via the density matrix. From it, we directly extract the localization length, which measures how far electrons spread in a system. Combined with finite-size scaling, this approach distinguishes metallic and insulating behavior across different dimensions naturally extends to interacting systems by using many-body ground-state wave functions. 

- For non-interacting systems, we define modular density matrix (MDM). The localization lengths extracted from it are benchmarked with standard transfer matrix method (TMM) and typical medium dynamical cluster approximation (TMDCA).

- For interacting systems, we define the subtraction density matrix (SDM) and calculate it using DMRG. We used this method to show
  (1) attractive interactions promote metallic behavior in disordered one-dimensional systems,
  (2) a metallic tendency in disordered two-dimensional Hubbard models.
